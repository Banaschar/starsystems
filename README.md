# starsystems

Small project to learn a bit OpenGL, with the end goal of rendering a proceduraly generated star system.


## Requirements:

For the dependencies (GLFW and Glew):
    build-essential libxmu-dev libxi-dev libgl-dev

For the engine library:
Nothing else, beside support for OpenGL 4.0.
Works on Ubuntu with a GeForce card and the latest proprietary nvidia driver, on anything else, no idea.
